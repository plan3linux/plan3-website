    <p>Plan3 (pronounced Plan Three, not hacker spelling for plane) is an distro that is installed on top of Arch Linux offering a family of desktop and software configurations.</p>

    <h1>Releases</h1>
    <h2>Codename Rhapsody</h2>
    <p>With Rhapsody, we are replacing the ISO based distribution to an installation script model for a few reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is easy to keep up to date</li>
      <li>It allows cross-compatibility across x86_64, ARM64, and even RISC-V</li>
      <li>Can be installed on other arch-distros like Manjaro, Arco Linux, and EndeavorOS. Artix support TBD</li>
      <li>Allows even further opportunities for non-arch installs like on Debian, Gentoo, RHEL, or other distros</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h2>Developer Preview 2023</h2>
    <p>Back in December 2023, Plan3 started as a bspwm-based Arch distro distributed with calamares. It is currently stale and unsupported.</p>
    <p>The configuration files were distributed through a custom arch repo, and we plan to replace that with a simpler home configuration manager</p>
